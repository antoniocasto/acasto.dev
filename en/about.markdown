# About Me

**Passionate iOS Developer**  
Passionate about **computer science** since childhood, I have always been deeply curious about how **software** works.  
The advent of **smartphones and apps** broadened my horizons, showing me the potential to create **solutions** that improve people’s daily lives.  

**Mobile development** has always been my main interest, and I satisfied my curiosity by taking both **university** and **extracurricular courses**.  
I started with **Android development**, then moved to **cross-platform development** with **Flutter**, and eventually transitioned to **iOS development** with **SwiftUI**.  

I turned my passion into a **professional career**, expanding my skill set by learning **UIKit**, architectural patterns such as **VIPER, MVVM, and TCA**, **AR technologies** like **ARKit and SceneKit**, and **CI/CD practices**, including tools like **SwiftLint and Fastlane**.  

Currently, I am focused on improving my approach to **building modular, testable, and highly scalable applications**.  
I enjoy **sharing challenges** with my team and collaborating to find the most **effective solutions**.  
I always **think before I code**. If I don’t know how to do something, I **research** and consult with more **experienced developers**.
