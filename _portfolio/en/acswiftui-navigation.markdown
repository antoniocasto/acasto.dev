*{{ page.description }}*

ACSwiftUINavigation is a Swift Package I developed to simplify navigation in SwiftUI applications by providing a clean separation of navigation logic from the views. It demonstrates my ability to contribute to the Swift community with reusable, modular code.

### Key Features:
- Structured approach to managing navigation state in SwiftUI.
- Simplifies deep linking and complex navigation flows.
- Easy integration via Swift Package Manager (SPM).

The source code is available on **[GitHub]({{ page.github }})**.
