# Welcome to acasto.dev

Hello everyone, and welcome to **acasto.dev**! <img src="{{ '/assets/images/icons/rocket.svg' | relative_url }}" class="inline-icon" alt="Rocket icon">This website was created as my personal space to share experiences, projects, and thoughts on iOS development.

## Who am I?
My name is Antonio Casto, and I am an iOS developer with a deep passion for technology and programming. My journey led me to focus on mobile development, especially with **SwiftUI** and **UIKit**, constantly exploring new solutions to build modular, scalable, and testable apps.

I have a keen eye for **design**, **smooth animations**, and the integration of **advanced technologies** like **ARKit** and **CoreML**, always striving to provide cutting-edge user experiences.

## What will you find here?
On this blog, I want to cover topics related to iOS development, from theory to practice. Here are some of the main themes:

- <img src="{{ '/assets/images/icons/phone.svg' | relative_url }}" class="inline-icon" alt="Phone icon">**SwiftUI and UIKit**: best practices, tutorials, and practical tips.
- <img src="{{ '/assets/images/icons/layers.svg' | relative_url }}" class="inline-icon" alt="Layers icon">**iOS app architectures**: MVVM, VIPER, TCA, and my approach to scalable app development.
- <img src="{{ '/assets/images/icons/spark.svg' | relative_url }}" class="inline-icon" alt="Spark icon">**Automation and CI/CD**: improving workflow with tools like Fastlane, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI.
- <img src="{{ '/assets/images/icons/code.svg' | relative_url }}" class="inline-icon" alt="Code icon">**Development experiences**: challenges faced, mistakes made, and lessons learned.
- <img src="{{ '/assets/images/icons/palette.svg' | relative_url }}" class="inline-icon" alt="Palette icon">**Personal projects**: behind-the-scenes of my apps and the technologies I am experimenting with.

## A site with many goals

This website is not just a blog—it is also my **portfolio**, where you can find some of my personal and experimental projects. Everything I share here reflects my personal opinions and professional growth journey. I have optimized **SEO, accessibility, and performance** to ensure a smooth and efficient experience.

In upcoming posts, I will dive deeper into my journey: starting from my **university career**, transitioning into programming and mobile development, and ultimately specializing in **iOS**, sharing the choices that led me here. I will also dedicate a post to how I **built this website**, from the technological choices to optimization strategies.

If you are an iOS developer, a tech enthusiast, or simply curious to see what I’m working on, you are in the right place! <img src="{{ '/assets/images/icons/smile.svg' | relative_url }}" class="inline-icon" alt="Smile icon">
